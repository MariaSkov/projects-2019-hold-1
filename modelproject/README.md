# Modelproject

In the project we describes a New Keynesian model with backward-looking expecations. We describes the equilibrium and reduces it to a two-equation system. We use different plots to illustrate the equilibrium. Further we show how to compute impulse response functions on each endogenous variable and show graphically how demand shocks propogate in the economy. Lastly, we use an interactive design to perform simulations using the model. The design lets the user choose different parameter values and graph the simulation again. In addition, we add an extension in the crisis factor.
